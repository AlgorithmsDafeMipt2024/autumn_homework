# Alien dictionary

Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, find the order of characters in the language.
For example, given the following dictionary:
### {"hl", "ld", "wd", "dd"}

The order of characters in the alien language is: 
### "hlwd"

## P.S. The order of the characters must be unambiguously defined with the words in the dictionary.
If not, the program will determine the character order, which can be determined by the word order in the dictionary, but this character order may not be the only possible one.
